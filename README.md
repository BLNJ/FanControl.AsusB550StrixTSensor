# ASUS ROG STRIX B550 FanControl T-Sensor Plugin

This is just a little Plugin I wrote to add the Temperatures reading from the ASUS ROG STRIX B550 Motherboards T-Sensor to FanControl.<br />
Honestly I only wrote that for me, since I use the T-Sensor to Monitor my Watercooling Water temperature, but it might be useful for someone else.

## Installing
Just copy the Files from the Release ZIP into the Plugins Folder from FanControl and just completely restart the Application.<br />
Maybe make sure that the Plugin is activated in the Sensor Settings

## How it works
This just makes use of OpenHardwareMonitor, where I look for a specific Sensor from the Motherboard.
Nothing fancy really and just threw this together in a few minutes.

## Building
In order to Build the Plugin you have to copy "FanControl.Plugins.dll" from your FanControl Installation into the "Dependencies" Folder.<br />
After that just recover the NuGet Packages (which VisualStudio should do itself) and youÂ´re good to go.

## Debugging
For this I created a seperate Project with the ending ".Test", which replicates the behaviour of FanControl.<br />
Make sure you start VisualStudio as Admin, since FanControl and all Plugins itself also run with elevated privileges. And otherwise OpenHardwareMonitor cant see the underlying Sensors.
